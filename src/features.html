Notes to Grader
For lights I used a hemisphere light to light the scene, 2 Point lights for the lamps, 
and 1 spot light for the center light. I am trying to make a spooky graveyard. I also added helpers to the lights 
(except hemisphere), so you can see them easily. Hopefully it is clear that there are more than 20 shapes present!
