Notes to Grader
I used a cylinder, cube and icosahedron for my three shapes. I also decided to do a dynamic camera instead of stationary because I thought it would be more fun!
That animated thing in the middle is supposed to be a campfire lol. I also imported a model of a tree and added a metallic texture to it, it may be hard to see it
but you can easily see the texture in action when you look at the tree from above it!
